# Background: `continues_on` and `schedule_from`:

`std::execution` has two customizable algorithms for transfering execution from one
context to another: `continues_on` and `schedule_from`. The reason for having two is due
to the fact there are two execution contexts in play: the context we're transitioning
_from_ and the one we're transitioning _to_.

A generic execution framework cannot know how to transition between arbitrary contexts;
that is an NxM problem. Instead, `std::execution` provides a way for schedulers to
separately customize how to transition to and from a standard thread of execution (ToE);
i.e., `std::thread` or `main`. Transitions between unrelated contexts is accomplised with
a hop through a ToE. We accomplish this by providing two customization points: one for
specifying any special sauce needed to transfer _from_ a standard ToE, and another for the
transfer back.

The `schedule_from` algorithm looks for customizations based on the domain of the
destination, and the `continues_on` algorithm dispatches based on the domain of the
source. A "domain" is a tag type associated with an execution context that is used to find
algorithm customizations for that context. The `continues_on` algorithm is required to
lower to the result of a call to `schedule_from`. In this way, every context transition
gets all the special sauce it needs to get from one arbitrary context to another.

We can see this in the definitions of the `continues_on` and `schedule_from`
customizations points:

                 <em><code class="sourceCode default">make-sender</code></em>(schedule_from, sched, sndr))</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

By asking for the predecessor sender's domain, `continues_on` uses the domain of the
source to find its customization. And by asking for the scheduler's domain,
`schedule_from` uses the domain of the destination.

The final piece is the transformation, within the `connect` customization point, of the
`continues_on` sender to the `schedule_from` sender, which is done with the
`continues_on.transform_sender(Sndr, Env)` member function (see
[exec.continues.on#5]{.sref}).

# The Problems

## Problem 1: A mix-up

When `connect`-time customization was added to `std::execution` in [@P2999R3], the logic
of `continues_on`/`schedule_from` customization accidentally got reversed: The
exposition-only _`get-domain-late`_ function, which is called from `connect`, determines
the domain used to find a sender transform function. It says:

> > ```c++
> > template<class Sndr, class Env>
> >   constexpr auto @_get-domain-late_@(const Sndr& sndr, const Env& env) noexcept;
> > ```
>

>        * `get_domain(get_scheduler(env))`
>        * `default_domain()`

Paragraph 14.1 above gets the roles of `continues_on` and `schedule_from` mixed up. They
should be reversed.

-----

## Problem 2: A mis-`connect`

All of the adaptor algorithm CPOs use the domain of the predecessor(s) to find
customizations. For example, `then(sndr, fn)` returns
```transform_sender(@_`get-domain-early`_@(sndr), @_`make-sender`_@(then, fn, sndr))```;
i.e., the domain is pulled from `sndr`. A sender that advertizes a domain is making an
assertion about where it will complete. Where the predecessor completes is where the
current sender's continuation will execute.

If we look at the `connect` customization point at how a late customization is found, we
see that before it does anything else, it transforms the input sender as follows:

> ```c++
> transform_sender(decltype(@_`get-domain-late`_@(sndr, get_env(rcvr))){}, sndr, get_env(rcvr))
> ```

We can see that when passed a `then` sender, we ask the `then` sender for its domain (and
use the domain of the receiver's env as a fallback). That means that for `then` senders,
`connect` dispatches to a customization based on the domain of the `then` sender itself.
That is different from early customization, which used the domain of the predecessor. The
inconsistency is unintentional.

For `then` and most other adaptors, it doesn't make any difference. The `then` sender
completes wherever its predecessor completes, so the domain of `then` is the same as the
domain for the predecessor. That is not the case for all algorithms, though. For
`continues_on`, the domain on which it completes can be different from the domain on which
its predecessor completes.

In short, for `continues_on` and friends, `connect` is using the wrong domain to dispatch
to a customization.

| Customization phase     | Expression                                                 | Domain used to find customization of `continues_on` |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
| Early                   | `schedule(A) | continues_on(B)`{.cpp}                                   | ✅ Domain of scheduler `A`             |
| Late                    | ```connect(schedule(A) | continues_on(B), @_`some-receiver`_@)```{.cpp} | ❌ Domain of scheduler `B`             |

----

## Problem 3: A muddle

The `connect` customization point uses _`get-domain-late`_ to determine the domain to use
when applying a sender transformation. Quite apart from mixing up `schedule_from` and
`continues_on`, _`get-domain-late`_ incorrectly gives precedence to the sender's domain
over that of the receiver. The (flawed) reasoning was that a sender starts where its
predecessor completes, which makes intuitive sense when reading a sender chain:

> ```c++
> int main()
> {
>   sender auto sndr = just() | continues_on(sch) | then([] { return puts("hello world"); });
>   auto [status] = sync_wait(std::move(sndr)).value();
>   return status;
> }
> ```

Reading the above code, one might naturally infer that the `then` sender will start on
the execution context associated with `sch` because it appears to the right of the
`continues_on(sch)` expression in pipe syntax.

The trouble is: that's not true. Without the pipe syntax, the above statement looks like
this:

> ```c++
> sender auto sndr = then(continues_on(just(), sch), [] { return puts("hello world"); });
> ```

Writing it like above makes it clearer that `sndr` is a `then` sender. `sync_wait`
connects `sndr` with a receiver resulting in a `then` operation state. `sync_wait` will
then call `start` on the operation state. Therefore, the `then` sender in this example
actually gets started on the main thread of execution, not on one of `sch`'s execution
agents. It _completes_ on one of `sch`'s execution agents, but it does not start there.

If we want to dispatch based on where a sender will start, we should not be asking the
sender. A sender can only know where it will complete. The receiver knows where it will
start. The receiver is an extension of the parent sender. The parent sender starts the
child, and so it can pass information to the child about where `start` is being called
from. It does so via the `get_domain` query in its receiver's environment.

Therefore, _`get-domain-late`_ is wrong to give precedence to the sender's domain. The
following example shows how this problem leads to incorrect execution.

## A broken example

Imagine a hypothetical sender adaptor algorithm `then_continues_on(fn, sch)` that is
customizable and behaves like `then(fn) | continues_on(sch)` (but is not implemented in
terms of them). For two schedulers `A` and `B`, a possible usage might be look like this:

> ```c++
> auto sndr = starts_on(A, just() | then_continues_on(fn, B));
> ```

For the sender expression above, the function `fn` will execute on an agent associated
with the scheduler `A`, so for correctness we must, at some point, dispatch on the domain
of `A`.

The `then_continues_on` sender is contructed with `just()` as its predecessor. The
`just()` sender does not have a domain, so no early customization of the
`then_continues_on` algorithm will be performed. That leaves late customization.

The specification of the `starts_on` algorithm requires it to connect the
`then_continues_on` sender with a receiver `R` for which `get_domain(get_env(R))` returns
the domain of scheduler `A`. That's good!

However, a sender's attributes should tell where the sender will complete if it can. The
sender `just() | then_continues_on(fn, B)` knows where it will complete: on scheduler `B`.
Therefore, the sender `just() | then_continues_on(fn, B)` -- let's call it `S` -- has a
domain: the domain of `B`.

So, what happens when `starts_on` calls `connect(S, R)`? Before doing anything, it applies
a transformation to the sender by calling:

> ```c++
> auto D = @_`get-domain-late`_@(S, get_env(R));
> auto S2 = transform_sender(D, S, get_env(R))
> ```

In the current wording, the type of `D` above is ... the domain of `B`. _\<sad trombone\>_
Why? Because _`get-domain-late`_ gives preference to the domain of the _sender_, and the
domain of `S` is that of `B`.

We said above that the function `fn` will execute on an agent of domain `A`, so we should
use `A`'s domain to find a customization. We know that early customization will not
dispatch based on the domain of `A`, and now we know that late customization will _also_
not dispatch based on the domain of `A`.

As a result, we find a customization of `then_continues_on` using the domain of `B`, but
it will actually execute in the domain of `A`. That's not good.

# Back to First Principles

The `get_domain` query actually has two meanings depending on what is being queried:

* When querying a sender's attributes, `get_domain` tells where the sender will
  _complete_.
* When querying a receiver's environment, `get_domain` tells where the sender will
  _start_.

What's more, this information propagates in different directions. Information about where
senders complete is passed from left-to-right (in pipeline order) while the senders are
being constructed, whereas information about where senders start is passed right-to-left
while the senders are being connected.

Both bits of information -- where a sender will start and where it will complete -- can
usefully contribute to the selection of an implementation for a sender and its successor.

1. As we build a sender up, we can use information about where the predecessor will
   complete -- known only by the predecessor -- to control how the sender is _constructed_.
2. As we are connecting a sender and a receiver, we can use information about where the
   sender will start -- known only by the receiver -- to control how the sender is
   _evaluated_.

This is a clean and orderly separation of concerns. _`get-domain-early`_ returns the
sender's domain and _`get-domain-late`_ returns the receiver's domain.

So are we done? Well, no.

## Special Cases

We still want `schedule_from` and `continues_on` to have special rules so that scheduler
authors can properly orchestrate the transitions from one context to another.
`schedule_from(sch, sndr)` should use `sch` to find a customization, and
`continues_on(sndr, sch)` should use `sndr` to find customizations, both when building the
senders and when connecting them.

The `schedule_from` customization point does not use _`get-domain-early`_; it only
looks at `sch` when looking for a sender transform, so that part is fine. But when
connecting a `schedule_from` sender, if we are only looking at the receiver's domain,
then we won't be using the domain of the scheduler as we should.

The `continues_on` algorithm also needs something different. _`get-domain-early`_
does the right thing by returning the domain of the predecessor, but again if we only
use the receiver's domain in `connect`, we won't be using the predecessor's domain
as we should.

The special nature of these two algorithms begs for special handling at `connect`
time. One solution would be to special-case them in _`get-domain-late`_. But there
is another case of interest that suggests a more general solution.


## Sender Consumers

Consider the following code, which schedules some work on a GPU scheduler and
then waits for it to complete:

> ```c++
> namespace se = std::execution;
> gpu_context gpu; // non-standard
> 
> se::sender auto sndr = se::schedule(gpu.get_scheduler()) | se::then([]{ return 42; });
> auto [result]        = se::sync_wait(std::move(sndr));
> ```

Launching work on a GPU and blocking for the result requires GPU-specific primitives. How
then should `sync_wait` find such a custom implementation? The sender knows that it will
complete on the GPU, so perhaps `sync_wait` should use ```@_`get-domain-early`_@(sndr)```
to find a customization.

But `sync_wait` knows the environment of the receiver it will use to connect the sender.
It stands to reason that `sync_wait` should use ```@_`get-domain-late`_@(sndr,
@_`sync-wait-env`_@{...})``` to determine the domain to use. This becomes more obvious
when we consider a possible overload of `sync_wait` that accepts an environment as a
second parameter. Certainly then, when the user has given `sync_wait` an environment, it
should use it to find a customization.

The trouble is that if `sync_wait` uses _`get-domain-late`_ to find a customization,
and if _`get-domain-late`_ only asks the environment for the domain (with special-cases
for `schedule_from` and `continues_on`), then it will not find the custom GPU
implementation of `sync_wait`.

We have a carve-out in _`get-domain-late`_ for `schedule_from` and `continues_on` senders.
It seems we _also_ need a carve-out for GPU senders ... but that's absurd! If a GPU domain
need a carve-out, then other domains will surely need a carve-out too. We need a generic
solution.

## `get_domain_override`

Senders need to have a way to override the domain of the receiver. With such a mechanism,
we can replace the special-case handling of `schedule_from` and `continues_on` with the
generic solution. The _`get-domain-late`_ helper would first ask the sender if it has
a "late-domain override". If so, that is the domain returned. Otherwise, it queries the
receiver's environment as per usual.

All we need is one new sender attribute query, tentatively called `get_domain_override`. The
`continues_on` and `schedule_from` senders would define this attribute, `continues_on` to
return the domain of the predecessor and `schedule_from` to return the domain of the
scheduler. And for the GPU sender case, the GPU domain can have an early transform that
wraps all senders so that they too define that attribute.


## The example, repaired

With the new dispatching rules, let's reconsider our `then_continues_on` example from the
previous section, which involved the expression:

> ```c++
> starts_on(A, just() | then_continues_on(fn, B))
> ```

The `then_continues_on` operation will execute on scheduler `A`, so we want the domain of
`A` to be used to look for a customization for the `then_continues_on` algorithm.

Recall that when the `starts_on` algorithm connects the sender
`just() | then_continues_on(fn, B)`, aka `S`, to its receiver `R`, `connect` transforms
`S` with:

> ```c++
> auto D = @_get-domain-late_@(S, get_env(R));     // <- What is D?
> auto S2 = transform_sender(D, S, get_env(R));
> ```

The interesting bit is what happens in _`get-domain-late`_ because that determines the
domain used to look for a customization of `then_continues_on`. The following table shows
how the late domain is computed before the proposed change and after.

With the old rules, we end up using the domain of `B` to look for a late

Recall that the expression we are evaluating is:

> ```c++
> starts_on(A, just() | then_continues_on(fn, B));

Since the `then_continues_on` operation will execute on scheduler `A`, we
_should_ be using the domain of `A` to look for a lazy customization, and with

# Summary of Proposed Changes


1. Add a non-forwarding `get_domain_override` query with no default implementation.

2. Give meaning to the `get_scheduler` query by requiring that an operation be started on
   an execution agent associated with the scheduler from the environment of the receiver
   used to create the operation. In other words, after `auto op = connect(sndr, rcvr)`, if
   `op.start()` is called, it must be called from an agent associated with
   `get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr))` if that expression is well-formed.

3. Similarly, require that operations are started on an agent of an execution context
   whose domain is `get_domain(get_env(rcvr))` if that expression is well-formed. [The
   implication of bullets (2) and (3) is that if both `get_domain(get_env(rcvr))` and
   `get_domain(get_scheduler(get_env(rcvr)))` are well-formed, they shall have the same
   type.]{.note}

4. Tweak the definitions of _`SCHED-ATTRS`_ and _`SCHED-ENV`_ to preserve the properties
   specified in bullets (2) and (3) above.

5. Simplify the definition of the exposition-only _`completion-domain`_ helper,
   which no longer needs a configurable default.

6. Specify that `get_domain_override(get_env(schedule_from(sch, sndr)))` returns the
   domain of `sch`.

7. Specify that `get_domain_override(get_env(continues_on(sndr, sch)))` returns the domain
   of `sndr` (if it has one).

8. Specify that `get_domain_override(get_env(starts_on(sch, sndr)))` returns the domain
   of `sch`.

9. The expression _`get-domain-late`_`(sndr, env, def)` should be equivalent to:

   1. `get_domain_override(get_env(sndr))` if that expression is well-formed.
   3. Otherwise, `get_domain(env)` if that expression is well-formed.
   4. Otherwise, `get_domain(get_scheduler(env))` if that expression is well-formed.
   5. Otherwise, `def`.

10. Specify that `sync_wait` and `sync_wait_with_variant` use
   ```@_`get-domain-late`_@(sndr, @_`sync-wait-env`_@{}, @_`get-domain-early`_@(sndr))```
   when looking for a customization.


# Implementation Experience

The design presented here is the result of a project to reimplement the GPU scheduler for
NVIDIA's [CCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl) library. The old GPU scheduler, which is
currently still being used by [stdexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec), uses early
customization exclusively. This requires that every algorithm is reimplemented from
scratch for the GPU, resulting in a large amount of code duplication. Employing late
customization would result in more accurate dispatch and facilitate more code reuse.

With `std::execution`'s current customization scheme, it was impossible for `connect` to
find the GPU customization for the `continues_on` algorithm. Pulling on that thread
revealed the other problems discussed in [Section 2]{#the-problems}. Solving the problems
first required a deeper understanding of the separate roles senders and receivers play in
selecting a domain. That deeper understanding informed the design proposed in this paper.

The newly redesigned GPU scheduler, which uses this proposed design, can be found in
[this pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cccl/pull/4579) for the CCCL repository on
GitHub, and [this other pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA/stdexec/pull/1542)
implements this proposed design for stdexec, the reference implementation.

# Future Directions

This paper revealed a need for a `sync_wait` overload that accepts an environment
in addition to a sender, like:

> ```c++
> template <sender Sndr, queryable Env>
> auto sync_wait(Sndr&& sndr, Env&& env);
> ```

With such an overload, the user could specify a scheduler corresponding to the current
execution context (maybe `sync_wait` is being called from the GPU!), which would in turn
determine what `sync_wait` implementation gets selected.

The `env` parameter would also give callers a way to parameterize the `sync_wait`
algorithm with an allocator, or a stop token, or perhaps even a different delegation
scheduler.

A separate paper will propose such an overload.

# Proposed Resolution

[Introduce the notion of "execution domains" by changing [exec.async.ops#1]{.sref} as
follows:]{.ednote}

> [1]{.pnum} An _execution resource_ is a program entity that manages a (possibly dynamic)
>    set of execution agents ([thread.req.lockable.general]{.sref}), which it uses to
>    execute parallel work on behalf of callers.
> 
>    [The currently active thread, a system-provided thread pool, and uses of an API
>    associated with an external hardware accelerator are all examples of execution
>    resources.]{.example}
> 
>    Execution resources execute asynchronous operations. An execution resource is either
>    valid or invalid.
> 
>    [An execution resource has an associated _execution domain tag_ that determines
>    the set of implementations to be used for customizable sender algorithms (see below).
>    The execution agents managed by the execution resource share the resource's
>    execution domain tag.]{.add}


[Change [exec.async.ops#10] as follows, connecting a scheduler's domain with that of
its execution resource:]{.ednote}

> [10]{.pnum} A _scheduler_ is an abstraction of an execution resource with a uniform,
>    generic interface for scheduling work onto that resource. It is a factory for senders
>    whose asynchronous operations execute value completion operations on an execution
>    agent belonging to the scheduler's associated execution resource. A
>    _schedule-expression_ obtains such a sender from a scheduler. A _schedule sender_ is
>    the result of a schedule expression. On success, an asynchronous operation produced
>    by a schedule sender executes a value completion operation with an empty set of
>    result datums. Multiple schedulers can refer to the same execution resource. A
>    scheduler can be valid or invalid. A scheduler becomes invalid when the execution
>    resource to which it refers becomes invalid, as do any schedule senders obtained from
>    the scheduler, and any operation states obtained from those senders. [A scheduler has
>    an associated execution domain tag that it inherits from its associated execution
>    resource.]{.add}


[To [execution.syn]{.sref}, add the following:]{.ednote}
