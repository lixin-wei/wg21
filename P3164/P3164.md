Synopsis
--------

This paper aims to improve the user experience of the sender framework by giving
it better diagnostics when used incorrectly.

First, it moves the diagnosis of many invalid sender expression earlier, when
the expression is constructed, rather than later when it is connected to a
receiver. A trivial change to the sender adaptor algorithms makes it possible
for the majority of sender expressions to be type-checked this way, giving the
user immediate feedback when they've made a mistake.

Second, this paper proposed changes to the `transform_completion_signatures`
alias template to allow it to serve as a meta-exception propagation channel.
This helps with late (`connect`-time) type checking by allowing type computation
errors from deeply nested senders to propagate to the API boundary, where they
can be reported concisely.

Executive Summary
-----------------

Below are the specific changes this paper proposes in order to improve the
diagnostics emitted by sender-based codes:

1. Define a "non-dependent sender" to be one whose completions are knowable
   without an environment.

2. Extend the awaitable helper concepts to support querying a type whether it is
   awaitable in an arbitrary coroutine (without knowing the promise type). For
   example, anything that implements the awaiter interface (`await_ready`,
   `await_suspend`, `await_resume`) is awaitable in any coroutine, and should
   function as a non-dependent sender.

3. Add support for calling `get_completion_signatures` without an environment
   argument.

4. Change the definition of the `completion_signatures_of_t` alias template to
   support querying a sender's non-dependent signatures, if such exist.

5. Require the sender adaptor algorithms to preserve the "non-dependent sender"
   property  wherever possible.

6. Add "Mandates:" paragraphs to the sender adaptor algorithms to require them
   to hard-error when passed non-dependent senders that fail type-checking.

7. Extend the eager type checking of the `let_` family of algorithms to
   hard-error if the user passes a lambda that does not return a sender type.

8. Change `transform_completion_signatures` to propagate any intermediate types
   that are not specializations of the `completion_signatures<>` class template.
   For type errors that occur when computing a sender's completion signatures,
   sender authors can return a custom type that describes the error and have
   it automatically propagates through adaptors that use
   `transform_completion_signatures`.

9. For any algorithm that eagerly `connect`s a sender (`sync_wait`,
   `start_detached`, `ensure_started`, `split`), hard-error (_i.e._
   `static_assert`) if the sender fails to type-check rather than SFINAE-ing the
   overload away.

Revision History
----------------

**R2**:

* Remove the `sender_in<Sndr, Env...>` constraint on the
   `completion_signatures_of_t<Sndr, Env...>` alias.

* Specify `get_completion_signatures(sndr, env)` to dispatch to
   `get_completion_signatures(sndr)` as a last resort, per suggestion from
   Lewis Baker.

* Add encouragement for implementors to use the completion signatures of the
   sender adaptor algorithms to propagate type errors.

* Add a [design discussion](#design-considerations-1) about the decision to
   _infer_ that types returned from `get_completion_signatures` represent errors
   if they are not specializations of `completion_signatures<>`.


**R1**:

* Change the specification of `transform_completion_signatures` to propagate
   types that are not specialization of the `completion_signatures<>` class
   template. This makes it easier to use an algorithm's completion signatures
   to communicate type errors from child senders.

* For the customization points `let_value`, `let_error`, and `let_stopped`,
   mandate that the callable's possible return types all satisfy `sender`.

* Change _Requires:_ to _Mandates_: for algorithms that eagerly connect
   senders.

**R0**:

Improving early diagnostics
---------------------------

### Problem Description

Type-checking a sender expression involves computing its completion signatures.
In the general case, a sender's completion signatures may depend on the
receiver's execution environment. For example, the sender:

```c++
read_env(get_stop_token)
```

... when connected to a receiver `rcvr` and started, will fetch the stop token from
the receiver's environment and then pass it back to the receiver, as follows:

```c++
auto st = get_stop_token(get_env(rcvr));
set_value(move(rcvr), move(st));
```

Without an execution environment, the sender `read_env(get_stop_token)` doesn't know
how it will complete.

The type of the environment is known rather late, when the sender is connected
to a receiver. This is often far from where the sender expression was
constructed. If there are type errors in a sender expression, those errors will
be diagnosed far from where the error was made, which makes it harder to know
the source of the problem.

It would be far preferable to issue diagnostics while *constructing* the sender
rather than waiting until it is connected to a receiver.

### Non-dependent senders

The majority of senders have completions that don't depend on the receiver's
environment. Consider `just(42)` -- it will complete with the integer `42` no
matter what receiver it is connected to. If a so-called "non-dependent" sender
advertised itself as such, then sender algorithms could eagerly type-check the
non-dependent senders they are passed, giving immediate feedback to the
developer.

For example, this expression should be immediately rejected:

```c++
just(42) | then([](int* p) { return *p; })
```


The `then` algorithm can reject `just(42)` and the above lambda because the
arguments don't match: an integer cannot be passed to a function expecting an
`int*`. The `then` algorithm can do that type-checking only when it knows the
input sender is non-dependent. It couldn't, for example, do any type-checking if
the input sender were `read_env(get_stop_token)` instead of `just(42)`.

And in fact, some senders *do* advertise themselves as non-dependent, although
P2300 does not currently do anything with that extra information. A sender can
declare its completions signatures with a nested type alias, as follows:

```c++
template <class T>
struct just_sender {
  T value;

  using completion_signatures =
    std::execution::completion_signatures<
      std::execution::set_value_t(T)
    >;

  // ...
};
```


Senders whose completions depend on the execution environment cannot declare
their completion signatures this way. Instead, they must define a
`get_completion_signatures` customization that takes the environment as an
argument.

We can use this extra bit of information to define a `non_dependent_sender`
concept as follows:

```c++
template <class Sndr>
concept non_dependent_sender =
  sender<Sndr> &&
  requires {
    typename remove_cvref_t<Sndr>::completion_signatures;
  };
```

A sender algorithm can use this concept to conditionally dispatch to code that
does eager type-checking.


### Suggested Solution

The authors suggests that this notion of non-dependent senders be given fuller
treatment in P2300. Conditionally defining the nested typedef in generic sender
adaptors -- which may adapt either dependent or non-dependent senders -- is
awkward and verbose. We suggest instead to support calling
`get_completion_signatures` either with _or without_ an execution environment.
This makes it easier for authors of sender adaptors to preserve the
"non-dependent" property of the senders it wraps.

We suggest that a similar change be made to the `completion_signatures_of_t`
alias template. When instantiated with only a sender type, it should compute the
non-dependent completion signatures, or be ill-formed.

### Comparison Table

Consider the following code, which contains a type error:

```c++
auto work = just(42)
          | then([](int* p) { // <<< ERROR here
              //...
            });
```

### Design Considerations

#### Why have two ways for non-dependent senders to publish their completion signatures?

The addition of support for a customization of `get_completion_signatures` that
does not take an environment obviates the need to support the use of a nested
`::completion_signatures` alias. In a class, this:

```c++
auto get_completion_signatures() ->
	std::execution::completion_signatures<
		std::execution::set_value_t(T)
	>;
```

... works just as well as this:

```c++
using completion_signatures =
	std::execution::completion_signatures<
		std::execution::set_value_t(T)
	>;
```

Without a doubt, we could simplify the design by dropping support for the
latter. This paper suggests retaining it, though. For something like the
`just_sender`, providing type metadata with an alias is more idiomatic and less
surprising, in the author's opinion, than defining a function and putting the
metadata in the return type. That is the case for keeping the `typename
Sndr::completion_signatures` form.

The case for adding the `sndr.get_completion_signatures()` form is that it makes
it simpler for sender adaptors such as `then_sender` to preserve the
"non-dependent" property of the senders it adapts. For instance, one could
define `then_sender` like:

```c++
template <class Sndr, class Fun>
struct then_sender {
	Sndr sndr_;
	Fun fun_;

	template <class... Env>
	auto get_completion_signatures(Env&&... env) const
	  -> some-computed-type;

    //....
};
```

... and with this one member function support both dependent and non-dependent
senders while preserving the "non-dependent-ness" of the adapted sender.

Improving late diagnostics
--------------------------

### Problem description

Experience implementing and using sender-based libraries has taught the author
several things:

1. Concepts-based constraints on sender algorithms and their inner workings do
   more harm than good. The diagnostics are generally poor. The constraint
   failure may happen deep in a sender expression tree, but the diagnostic the
   user sees is simply: "no overload found". That gives users exactly zero
   information about the cause of the error.

   Dropping the one-and-only possible overload from the overload set typically
   doesn't help users either, most of whom don't care about SFINAE. What they
   want are good diagnostics.

2. The current specification of the customization points and utilities make
   type errors SFINAE-able: either a construct type-checks or else it is
   ill-formed. That makes it very difficult for sender adaptors to propagate
   type errors from their child senders. In runtime code, we have exceptions
   to propagate errors to API boundaries. We have no equivalent for type
   computations, and P2300's current facilities offer no help.

### Suggested solution

To address the first issue, the author recommends using `static_assert`s
instead of `requires` clauses for type errors in sender algorithms.

But what condition should we put in the `static_assert`? If we use the same
predicates that are in the `requires` clauses, the errors will be little better.
Instead of "no overload found", users will see: "`static_assert: sender_to<Sndr,
Rcvr> evaluated to false`", followed by a (lengthy and probably truncated)
concepts backtrace. Buried in there somewhere _may_ be the cause of the error
for those entripid enough to dig for it.

This brings us to the second issue: propagating type errors from deep inside a
sender tree evaluation to the API boundary where it can be concisely reported to
the user.

The best way the author has found to report "late" (at `connect` time)
type-checking failures is via the sender's completion signatures. If a type
error happens while trying to compute `completion_signatures_of_t<Sndr, Env>`,
instead of making the type ill-formed, it is better for it to name a type that
communicates the error to the user.

Algorithms like `sync_wait` can then `static_assert` that the result of
`completion_signatures_of_t<Sndr, Env>` is a specialization of the
`completion_signatures` class template. If it instead names a type that is
descriptive of the error, the name of that type will appear prominently in the
compiler's (blissfully short) diagnostic.

Consider the following code, which has a type error in it:

```c++
thread_context ctx; // non-standard extension
auto sch = ctx.get_scheduler();

using namespace std::execution;

auto work = read_env(get_delegatee_scheduler)
          | let_value([](auto sched) {
              // create some work to delegate to the main thread.
              auto delegated_work =
                just() | then([] {
                  std::puts("Hello, world!");
                });

              // launch the work on the delegation scheduler.
              start_on(sched, delegated_work); // <<< ERROR HERE
            });

auto s = start_on(sch, work);

sync_wait(s);
```

The error in the code above is that the lambda passed to `let_value` must return
a sender. The error cannot be caught early because this is a dependent sender:
the type of the delegation scheduler isn't known until we pass the sender to
`sync_wait`.

Compiling this with the [µstdex](https://github.com/ericniebler/ustdex) library,
which uses the suggested technique of propagating descriptive type errors via
the completion signatures, results in the following diagnostic:

```bash
[build] /home/eniebler/Code/ustdex/include/ustdex/detail/sync_wait.hpp:139:7: error: static_assert failed due to requirement '_is_completion_signatures<
ustdex::ERROR<ustdex::WHERE (ustdex::IN_ALGORITHM, ustdex::let_value_t), ustdex::WHAT (ustdex::FUNCTION_MUST_RETURN_A_SENDER), ustdex::WITH_FUNCTION ((l

[build]   sync_wait(s);
[build]            ^
[build] 1 error generated.
```

This is the complete diagnostic. As you can see, the source of the error has
been propagated out of the sender expression tree and reported at the API
boundary, in `sync_wait`. The diagnostic contains only the information the
user needs to fix the problem.

### Another problem and a solution

For the authors of sender adaptor algorithms, this meta-error propagation
technique presents a neigh insurmountable metaprogramming challenge. Computing
completion signatures is hard enough. But now a child sender's completion
signatures may not actually be completion signatures! They could instead be an
error that the algorithm author must propagate in _their_ completion signatures,
or else lose the information about the root cause.

P2300 recognizes that manipulating completion signatures at compile time is
taxing. It provides a utility to help: `transform_completion_signatures`.
Given a set of completion signatures and some alias templates, it applies
transformations to the set, resulting in a new set of completion signatures.
Sender adaptor authors can use `transform_completion_signatures` to adapt
the child sender's completions.

With a few small changes, `transform_completions_signatures` can be made
to automatically propagate any intermediate types that might represent
errors, saving users the trouble of doing so manually. This paper
proposes those design changes.

### Comparison Table

Consider the following use of `transform_completion_signatures`:

```c++
struct ERROR_TOO_MANY_VALUES {};

template <class... Values>
using _value_completions_t = std::conditional_t<
                                 sizeof...(Values) > 1,
                                 ERROR_TOO_MANY_VALUES,
                                 completion_signatures<set_value_t(Values...)>
                              >;

// For a given sender and environment, check that the value completions
// never send more than one value.
template <class Sndr, class Env>
using _checked_completions = transform_completion_signatures<
                                 completion_signatures_of_t<Sndr, Env>,
                                 completion_signatures<>,
                                 _value_completions_t
                              >;

```

</table>

In the first case, the type error happens in the `_value_completions_t`
alias template. In the second case, the type error happens when trying
to ask the `read_env(get_scheduler)` sender what its completions are when
used with `empty_env`. That's an error because the `empty_env` does not
have a value for the `get_scheduler` query. In both cases, the error
gets propagated by `transform_completion_signatures` after the proposed
change.

### Design Considerations

A point was raised during LEWG design review that, after the proposed changes,
`transform_completion_signatures` will assume a type represents an error unless
it is a specialization of `completion_signatures<>`, and that it may be
preferrable to have a more explicit representation of a type error.

A different design would have `get_completion_signatures` return a compile-time
analogue of `std::expected`, and to further require that sender algorithms
propagate any unexpected results encountered when computing a sender's
completion signatures.

The author feels this is a reasonable request but advises against it for now.
For one, there is no difficulty in this instance distinguishing success from
error: only specializations of `completion_signatures<>` can represent success.
Anything else is by definition an error.

Also, with the coming of reflection ([P2996](https://wg21.link/P2996)) and
`constexpr` exceptions ([P3068](https://wg21.link/P3068)), a superior mechanism
for computing completion signatures with idiomatic non-local error propagation
seems plausible in the C++26 timeframe. That leads to author to believe that
this is not the right time to invest design effort codifying a library mechanism
to propagate type errors.

Proposed Wording
----------------

<span class="ednote">This proposed wording is based on
[P2300R9](https://wg21.link/P2300R9.html).</span>


<span class="ednote">Change [async.ops]/13 as follows:</span>


<blockquote>

13. A completion signature is a function type that describes a completion
    operation. An asychronous operation has a finite set of possible completion
    signatures corresponding to the completion operations that the asynchronous
    operation potentially evaluates ([basic.def.odr]). For a completion function
    `set`, receiver `rcvr`, and pack of arguments `args`, let `c` be the
    completion operation `set(rcvr, args...)`, and let `F` be the function type
    `decltype(auto(set))(decltype((args))...)`. A completion signature `Sig` is
    associated with `c` if and only if `MATCHING-SIG(Sig, F)` is `true`
    ([exec.general]). Together, a sender type and an environment type `Env`
    determine the set of completion signatures of an asynchronous operation that
    results from connecting the sender with a receiver that has an environment
    of type `Env`. <span class="note">The type of the receiver does not affect
    an asychronous operation’s completion signatures, only the type of the
    receiver’s environment.</span> <ins>A sender type whose completion
    signatures are knowable independent of an execution environment is known as
    a <dfn>non-dependent sender</dfn>.

<span class="ednote">this subtly changes the meaning of `sender_in<Sndr>`.
Before the change, it tests whether a type is a sender when used specifically
with the environment `empty_env`. After the change, it tests whether a type is a

says that this type is a sender *regardless of the environment*. One can still
get the old behavior with `sender_in<Sndr, empty_env>`.</span>

<span class="ednote">Change [exec.awaitables] as follows:</span>

   by [expr.await]/3.2-4, where `p` is an lvalue referring to the coroutine’s
   promise type, `Promise`. This includes the invocation of the promise type’s

expressions could be type-checked eagerly but are not by P2300R8.
